**Mydon** is an open-source personal finance tracker built for efficient and structured money management.
It helps individuals take control of their finances with a clean, simple interface—while still supporting advanced use cases like double-entry accounting.
I created Mydon because I couldn't find a tool that made it easy to import bank statements and manage finances with proper bookkeeping principles.
